	<h1><P><font face = " Courier" size = "-1" color = "blue"> About Department
This department is running from 2001. The staff has developed required laboratories in the areas like Computer Hardware, Computer Networking & Security, Database Management System, Computer Graphics and Internet Technology in tune with real-time systems. </font></h1>
</P>
<p><i>The Internet access is provided to the students to update their knowledge in various fields. Currently, a project under AICTE Grant for Campus Networking is under success. The Computer Department is equipped with around 150 computers with multimedia software and LAN Systems with Internet connection.</i></p>
<p><font face = " script" size = "-1" color = "">The Department has purchased Latest Computer Servers and Network-based online teaching system software named Content Server. The department is sharing all infrastructural facilities of Information Technology Department. The laboratories in the department are well developed to cater needs of the students. Department is also offering Post Graduate course in Computer Science & Engineering since 2010.</p>
<p>Computer Engineering and Information Technology department run in a newly constructed, well-furnished building. The main strength of the department is highly qualified and well-experienced faculties. Also, the department is well equipped with an ample number of computer systems, networking of more than 250 nodes and required software and hardware. Department has well equipped 10 computer laboratories and two seminar halls. Campus Wide Network of college is handled by the department with 30 Wi-Fi access points with 1 controller. It has High-End Servers available for various activities.
Concept of modern computer</p>
<p><font face = "Verdana" size = "-1" color = "blue">The principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his seminal 1936 paper,On Computable Numbers. Turing proposed a simple device that he called "Universal Computing machine" and that is now known as a universal Turing machine. He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the stored program, where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory.</font></p>
<p>Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper. Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.

	<p>Computer engineering (CoE or CpE) is a branch of electrical engineering and computer science that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software.Computer engineers require training in electronic engineering, hardware-software integration, software design, and software engineering. It uses the techniques and principles of electrical engineering and computer science, and can encompass areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks, computer architecture and operating systems. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, yet it also demands them to integrate into the larger picture. Robots are one of the applications of computer engineering.</p>

<p>Computer engineering usually deals with areas including writing software and firmware for embedded microcontrollers, designing VLSI chips, designing analog sensors, designing mixed signal circuit boards, and designing operating systems. Computer engineers are also suited for robotics research, which relies heavily on using digital systems to control and monitor electrical systems like motors, communications, and sensors.</p>

<p>In many institutions of higher learning, computer engineering students are allowed to choose areas of in-depth study in their junior and senior year because the full breadth of knowledge used in the design and application of computers is beyond the scope of an undergraduate degree. Other institutions may require engineering students to complete one or two years of general engineering before declaring computer engineering as their primary focus</p>
